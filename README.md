# Customer-Feedback-Analysis-and-Improvement
#Project Overview

This project is structured into four key phases:

# SQL Database Setup and Data Collection: 

A relational database was designed using Microsoft SQL Server to manage customer feedback, including tables for feedback forms, customer profiles, and categories. Historical feedback data was imported, and SQL queries were created for data extraction and summarization.

# Data Warehouse and Python Processing:

A data warehouse was implemented to aggregate feedback data for analysis. Python was used for cleaning and preprocessing the data, with an emphasis on text processing for sentiment analysis.

# Sentiment Analysis and Azure Integration: 

Machine learning models were developed using Python to perform sentiment analysis, categorizing feedback as positive, neutral, or negative. Microsoft Azure services were integrated to provide enhanced data storage and computational resources.

# Deployment: 

The final model was deployed via a desktop application built with python GUI library, using the trained model to classify new feedbacks to gain insights from feedback trends.
